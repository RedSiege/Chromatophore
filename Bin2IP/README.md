## Bin2IP 
A utility for translating a raw shellcode file into IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

This script is based on Will Summerhill's IPv4Fuscation-Encrypted generation script. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/wsummerhill/IPv4Fuscation-Encrypted/blob/main/IPv4encrypt-shellcode.py).

The source code generated by this script is based in part on the [Orca000 HellShell project](https://gitlab.com/ORCA000/hellshell).

## Background
The Hive ransomware group was first observed storing shellcode as IP addresses in March of 2022. You can read SentinelOne's analysis of the technique [here](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/hive-ransomware-deploys-novel-ipfuscation-technique/).
